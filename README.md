# .scripts
bash utilities for ~/.local/bin

I store these scripts in ~/.scripts and sym-link
them to ~/.local/bin/ which is on the $PATH
Or just put .scripts on the path.

`OneDrive` is to sync a folder with MS OneDrive, and
is only useful on synced computers. It can be set to
run when X starts. I call it from ~/.xprofile

`dwm_bar.sh` is just to set the status bar on
Suckless DWM install. It is called from ~/.xprofile
